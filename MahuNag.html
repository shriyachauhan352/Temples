    <strong>History</strong>
    <br />

    <p>
        The Mahunag temple is dedicated to Lord mahunag, which is believed to be an avatar of lord Karn from Mahabharat. According to legend, a farmer found an idol of the lord Karn when he was plowing his field, Unaware of its significance, he kept the idol at his home. This was not liked by the god and several unfortunate things started to happen to his family, then on the advice of the elder people of the village, he installed the idol at a hilltop in a ceremony. The present Mahunag temple was built in the 17th century by Raja Shyam Sen. The idol of lord Karn is bought out on his birthday. The Idol can also be seen at an annual fair that is held in the month of July. The story behind the fair is also an interesting one. Once britishers took a local to its custody in shimla. The resident prayed to Lord mahunag to help him. It is believed that Lord Mahunag appeared inside the jail cell and helped him get out of the jail. To express his gratitude towards Mahunag Ji, he organized a ceremony. The ceremony is still conducted today in the form of Mela every year.<br />
