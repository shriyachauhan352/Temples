        According to the Ramayana, Hanuman stopped at the location to rest while searching for the Sanjivni Booti to revive Lakshmana. A giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010. At 108 feet (33 m), it surpasses the statue of Christ the Redeemer, which measures at 98 feet (30 m), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The cost of construction was Rs 1.5 crores. The public unveiling was officiated by Abhishek Bachchan.
