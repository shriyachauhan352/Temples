    <strong>History</strong>
    <br />

    <p>
        Kali Bari temple was originally built in 1823 by a Bengali Brahmin Ram Charan Brahamchari in the vicinity of Rothney Castle on Jakhoo Hill. That's why it resembles the Dakshineswar Kali Temple in Kolkata.[2] It is one of the ancient temples of the city and features a unique Hindu-style architecture along with blue coloured wooden idol of goddess Kali. Later, the British shifted the location of the temple to Bantony Hill. The temple trust formed in 1902 mainly consists of Bengali members.
