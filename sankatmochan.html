    <strong>History</strong>
    <br />

    <p>
        The temple was established in 1950 by prominent religious figure Neem Karoli Baba. He got so amazed by the beauty of Shimla that he spent 10–12 days in the forest area. Here while doing Yoga and meditation Baba got some instinct that Hanuman temple should be built on this site. Baba told his wish to his followers and eventually in the year of 1962 the then Lieutenant Governor Raja Bajrang Bahadur Singh and other followers started the construction of the temple. The idols of Lord Rama-Sita-Lakshmana, Lord Shiva and Lord Ganesha were also established in the temple. The temple was inaugurated on 21 June 1966 on the day of Tuesday. Gradually the temple gained a lot of popularity and faith.
